Description: WaveCrest is a statistical method that reconstructs gene expression trajectory in single cell RNA-seq experiments with ordered conditions. WaveCrest contains two modules - the first module implements an extended nearest insertion algorithm that searches for optimal cell orders, and the second module implements a spline fitting module that could be used to identify additional dynamic genes.
